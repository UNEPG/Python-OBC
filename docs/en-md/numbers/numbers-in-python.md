## Numbers in Python

Numbers in Python work like numbers you've seen elsewhere; you can apply all the things you've learned about basic math to Python.

To show you what I mean, start by typing a few numbers into the console below:

As you can tell, Python understands positive and negative numbers. 

## float numbers
The float type in Python represents the floating point number. Float is used to represent real numbers and is written with a decimal point dividing the integer and fractional parts. For example, 
- 97.98, 
- 32.3+e18, 
- -32.54e100

all are floating point numbers.
