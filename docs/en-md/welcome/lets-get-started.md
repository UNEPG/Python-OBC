## Let's get started
In this lecture, you will learn main contents such as:

**1. Numbers and Math**     
**2. Logic**    
**3. Variables**    
**4. Conditions**   
**5. Loops**        
**6. Objects**  
**7. Applications of Python (Reading Sensor Data)** 

### More about Python

To do this, we'll use a computer language called [Python](https://python.org/).

You can use Python to make websites, create games, and write scripts. The concepts we'll cover exist in other languages.

Understanding how (for example) loops work in Python will help you in other programming languages.
### Learning new things

Learning something new can be confusing, no matter what you're learning: a game, a ritual or tradition, a programming language, anything.

If you find parts of these sections confusing, remember that you're not alone; other people have found these ideas strange at first too.

The best thing to do is to keep reviewing the confusing part, typing variations on it into the console or trinkets (more about each of these in a moment!) until it makes more sense.

You might find programming with Python different from other things you've learned before, but you can do it!
