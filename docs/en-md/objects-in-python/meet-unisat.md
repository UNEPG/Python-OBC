## Meet Unisat
Remembered the Animation that we showed in the welcome page? Let's look at the code again:

Now, let's split down the code to something smaller:

UniSat is a Turtle that you control with code. Press run to see what this program does, and see if you can figure out what line tells UniSat to say,"Why, hello there!"

Don't worry if you don't understand all of the code. You don't have to to get started, and more and more of it will become familiar to you as you keep going.

Use the arrow or click Next to go to the next example!

As we saw in the last example, UniSat can move! When she moves, she draws a line. She can move `forward` and `backward` and turn `right` or `left` a certain number of degrees.

Run this example to see her move:

Ok, now I believe you understand the first animation, and can you try to make some more animations like that ?

### Turtles are Objects!
UniSat is a turtle. But what's a turtle? It's what's called an object. This means that a programmer has written some code that we can use to do cool things. In UniSat's case, she knows how to go forward, backward, left, and right because the people who wrote the turtle object thought those would be neat things for turtles to do.

At the beginning of all of our examples, we import turtle. This lets us use code that's already been written and gives Tina and any other turtles we make their abilities.

You can give Unisat a different name, and that newly named turtle will know how to do everything UniSat does. Give UniSat any name you choose in this example:

Hint: You'll have to change all of the names from UniSat to the name you choose. Otherwise, Python will be confused which one you're talking about.
